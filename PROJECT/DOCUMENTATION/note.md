# Kenya Premier League Match Predictor

## Overview
The Kenya Premier League Match Predictor is a machine learning-based system designed to predict match outcomes using historical data. The system uses various features such as team performance, player statistics, and historical match results to generate predictions.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Gather match data, player statistics, and team performance records.
- **Preprocessing**: Clean and transform the data for use in machine learning models.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features such as recent form, head-to-head records, and team strength.
- **Model Training**: Use machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Networks.
- **Prediction**: Provide probabilities of match outcomes (Win, Draw, Loss).
- **Evaluation**: Assess model accuracy using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection**
   - Obtain historical match results from sources such as API feeds or CSV datasets.
   - Include features like team form, goals scored/conceded, and player ratings.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Normalize numerical data.
   - Convert categorical data (e.g., teams) into numerical format using encoding techniques.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Compute rolling averages for team performance.
   - Analyze home vs away performance.
   - Extract key player statistics.

4. **Model Selection and Training**
   - Train models using algorithms such as:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Trees
     - Random Forest
     - Gradient Boosting
   - Tune hyperparameters using cross-validation.

5. **Prediction**
   - Input current match data into the trained model.
   - Generate match outcome probabilities.

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Compare predictions with actual results.
   - Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for scripting and model development.
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data processing.
- **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **Flask/Django** (Optional) for building a web interface.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of real-time match updates.
- Using deep learning models for better predictions.
- Deploying as a web or mobile application.


## API PORBLEM
- API finding the ones i require are not there thus the solution ive decided to monitor it myself and input the data into a file and from the file is able to extract the data and be able to run the code
